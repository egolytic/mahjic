## Problem Section

### The Problem with Mahjong Ratings Today

You play at your local league. You're pretty good — but how good?

Right now, there's no universal way to measure skill in American Mahjong. Some leagues track wins. Others don't track anything. And the ratings that do exist? They're locked in proprietary systems that don't talk to each other.

**You deserve better.**

## Solution Section

### Introducing Mahjic

A universal rating that follows you.

**One Rating, Any League**
Play at different clubs? Travel for tournaments? Your Mahjic rating combines all your results into one number — no matter where you play.

**Open & Transparent**
We use Glicko-2, the same proven system used by Lichess and other respected gaming platforms. The formula is public. Your rating is yours.

**Built for Community**
Mahjic isn't owned by any single league or corporation. It's an open standard that any organizer can adopt — free.

## The Math Section (Optional — for the curious)

### The Math Behind Mahjic

We use **Glicko-2**, developed by Dr. Mark Glickman at Boston University. It's a refinement of the classic Elo system with three key improvements:

1. **Rating Deviation (RD)** — Measures how confident we are in your rating. New players have high RD; it decreases as you play more games.

2. **Volatility** — Tracks how consistent you are. Erratic results? Higher volatility. Steady performance? Lower.

3. **Time decay** — Haven't played in a while? Your RD increases, reflecting uncertainty. This prevents "rating camping."

The formula is fully documented and open source. No black boxes.

## FAQ Section

### Questions?

**Is Mahjic free?**
Yes. Free to use, free to integrate. We may offer optional premium features for leagues in the future, but the core rating system will always be free.

**How is this different from other mahjong ratings?**
Most ratings are locked to a single platform or league. Mahjic is open — any league can participate, and your rating follows you everywhere. Think of it like how FIDE works for chess, but community-run and transparent.

**Can I trust the ratings?**
We use Glicko-2, a mathematically rigorous system used by major gaming platforms. Games submitted by verified leagues carry more weight, and we have anti-fraud measures in place.

**What if I only play casually?**
That's fine! You can track your games for fun without worrying about rankings. Set your profile to private if you prefer.

**Can I self-report games?**
Yes, but self-reported games require confirmation from all players and carry less weight than league-verified games.

**I run a league. How do I get started?**
Sign up for an organizer account, and you can start submitting games immediately via our web form or API.
