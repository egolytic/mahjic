## Problem Section

### The Problem with Mahjong Ratings Today

Some organizations want to lock up Mahjong ratings. Play only THEIR events. Use only THEIR platform. Your rating belongs to THEM.

That's not how it should work.

**Your skill is yours. Your rating should be too.**

---

## Solution Section

### Introducing Mahjic

The open rating system that belongs to the players.

**Play Anywhere**
Your local club. A friend's league. A tournament across the country. One rating follows you everywhere.

**Open & Transparent**
The algorithm is open source. No black boxes. Anyone can verify how ratings are calculated.

**Club-First Design**
Verified Sources (clubs, leagues, platforms) submit results. Players don't have to do anything — just play.

---

## How It Works Section

### How It Works

**1. Your Club Joins as a Verified Source**
Any club, league, or platform can apply to become a Verified Source. It's free.

**2. They Submit Your Games**
After each session, your club reports results. Web form, spreadsheet upload, or API — whatever works for them.

**3. Your Rating Updates**
Mahjic calculates your new rating based on who you played and how you did. Win against better players? Bigger gains.

**4. View Your Profile**
See your rating, history, and where you stand. Share your profile. Track your progress over time.

## The Algorithm Section

### The Math Behind Mahjic

We use **ELO with pairwise comparison**, adapted for 4-player Mahjong.

**Win Rate Matters**
You're compared against each player at your table. More mahjongs = higher win rate = you beat them.

**Opponent Strength Matters**
Beat higher-rated players? Bigger gains. Lose to lower-rated players? Bigger losses.

**Points Bonus (Leagues)**
For league and tournament play, point differentials add a small bonus (±5 max) on top of win-rate calculations.

The formula is fully documented and open source. No black boxes.

## Two Ratings Section

### Two Ratings. One Profile.

**Mahjic Rating**
All your games, against anyone. Your complete record.

**Verified Rating**
Only games against other Verified players. Used for official leaderboards.

Why two? To prevent gaming. Someone can't inflate their rating by playing fake accounts. The leaderboard only counts games against ID-verified players.

---

## FAQ Section

### Questions?

**Is Mahjic free?**
Yes for clubs and players. Verified player status costs $20/year (to cover ID verification costs).

**How is this different from other Mahjong ratings?**
Most ratings lock you into one platform. Mahjic is open — any club can participate, and your rating follows you everywhere.

**Can I trust the ratings?**
Yes. Only Verified Sources can submit games. Leaderboards only show ID-verified players. The algorithm is open source.

**What if I play at multiple clubs?**
Great! All your games feed into one rating. Play everywhere, one number.

**What if someone at my table doesn't want to be tracked?**
Clubs can submit them as anonymous or private. They still affect the table's ratings but won't have a public profile.

**I run a club. How do I get started?**
Apply to become a Verified Source. We'll review your application and get you set up with credentials.
