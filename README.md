2. [ ] Set up GitHub repo (github.com/mahjic or similar)
3. [ ] Build MVP landing page with waitlist
4. [ ] Implement Glicko-2 algorithm
5. [ ] Create basic player profiles + game entry
6. [ ] Recruit 2-3 beta leagues to test

## Why This Exists

To prevent any single organization from locking up mahjong ratings as a proprietary product. This is chess's Lichess, not tennis's ATP.
